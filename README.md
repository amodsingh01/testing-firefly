# Creating a GKE Cluster

This Terraform code creates a GKE cluster on Google Cloud Platform. The cluster is created with a single node pool, which can be customized using the variables in `variables.tf`.

To create the cluster, run the following commands:

```
terraform init
terraform apply
```

After the cluster is created, you can interact with it using the `gcloud` command line tool. For example, to get the credentials for the cluster, run:

```
gcloud container clusters get-credentials <cluster-name> --region <region>
```

Example output:

```
Outputs:

cluster_ca_certificate = "-----BEGIN CERTIFICATE-----\nMIIDWjCCAkKgAwIBAgIJA..."
cluster_endpoint        = "https://XXX.XXX.XXX.XXX"
cluster_name            = "my-cluster"
```
