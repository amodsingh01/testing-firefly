# Creating a GKE Cluster with VPC, Subnets, and Firewalls

This Terraform code creates a GKE cluster with a VPC, subnets, and firewalls. The VPC and subnets are defined in `vpc/main.tf`, the GKE cluster is defined in `gke/main.tf`, and the firewalls are defined in `firewall/main.tf`.

To create the resources, run the following commands:

```
terraform init
terraform apply
```

After the resources are created, you can interact with the GKE cluster using the `gcloud` command-line tool. For example, to get the credentials for the cluster, run:

```
gcloud container clusters get-credentials my-cluster --region <region> --project <project_id>
```

Example output:

```
Outputs:

cluster_name = "my-cluster"
```

Useful commands:

- `terraform init`: Initializes the Terraform working directory.
- `terraform plan`: Shows the execution plan for the current configuration.
- `terraform apply`: Applies the changes to the infrastructure.
- `terraform destroy`: Destroys the Terraform-managed infrastructure.
