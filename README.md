# Creating a Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE) Cluster

This Terraform template creates a GKE cluster on Google Cloud Platform (GCP). The cluster name, number of nodes, machine type, and disk size can be customized in `variables.tf`.

To create the cluster, run the following commands:

```
terraform init
terraform apply
```

After the cluster is created, you can interact with it using the `gcloud` command-line tool. For example, to get the credentials for the cluster, run:

```
gcloud container clusters get-credentials <cluster-name> --region <region>
```

This will add the cluster to your `kubeconfig` file and allow you to interact with it using `kubectl`.

Example output:

```
Outputs:

cluster_ca_certificate = "-----BEGIN CERTIFICATE-----\nMIIDWjCCAkKgAwIBAgIJA..."
cluster_endpoint        = "https://<endpoint>"
```
